Several features significantly impact house prices. 
Location and Neighborhood:
Location is paramount. Houses in desirable neighborhoods, close to amenities (schools, hospitals, shopping centers), and with good connectivity tend to command higher prices.
A safe and well-maintained neighborhood adds value.
Property Size and Layout:
Square footage matters. Larger homes generally have higher prices.
An efficient layout with functional spaces also affects prices.
Quality and Condition:
Overall quality (e.g., finishes, materials) influences prices. High-quality homes are more sought after.
Well-maintained properties with minimal repairs needed tend to sell at a premium.
Age and Historical Value:
Year of construction matters. Older homes may have historical charm, but newer constructions offer modern amenities.
Historical or unique properties can command higher prices.
Amenities and Upgrades:
Features like swimming pools, landscaping, and smart home technology impact prices.
Renovations (e.g., kitchen, bathrooms) add value.
School Districts:
Proximity to good schools affects prices. Families prioritize education quality.
Supply and Demand:
When demand exceeds supply, prices rise. Population growth and urbanization play a role.
Market conditions influence prices.
Economic Factors:
A growing economy, low unemployment, and favorable government policies boost property prices.
Interest rates and inflation also matter.
Infrastructure Development:
Improved infrastructure (roads, public transport) enhances property values.
Proximity to airports, highways, and public transit matters.
Market Sentiment and Trends:
Investor confidence and market trends impact prices.
External events (e.g., pandemic, economic shifts) affect buyer behavior.
